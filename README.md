# Results Management System

Welcome to the Results Management System (RMS) repository! This system is designed to manage and display results efficiently. Whether you're a student checking your grades or an administrator managing scores, RMS has you covered.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RMS project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- XAMPP installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Apache and MySQL.
- Git installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KIIZA-TREVOUR/ncis.git
   ```

2. Move the cloned repository to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. Typically, the path is:
   ```
   C:\xampp\htdocs\ncis
   ```

3. Start your XAMPP control panel and ensure that Apache and MySQL servers are running.

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost/ncis`.

That's it! You should now see the Results Management System up and running on your local machine.

### Usage

- As mentioned earlier, there's no need to set up a database locally since it's already configured remotely on other servers. The system is ready to use upon installation.
- Navigate through the interface to view and manage results according to your role (student, teacher, administrator, etc.).
- If you encounter any issues or have feedback, feel free to create an issue in this repository.
